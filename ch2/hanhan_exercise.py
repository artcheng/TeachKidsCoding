# In Michigan, the speed limit is 70 miles; in Kentudy, the speed limit is 75. If you drive at a speed 10 miles above the
# speed limit, you are fined 100 dollars per mile above the spieed limit;
# If you drive too slow, like 10 miles and more below the speed limit, you are given a warning that says 'turtle head';
# if you are driving at the speed (5 miles below or above the limit), you are given a smiley face:
# Jim was stopped three times. Driving at 100 miles in Michigan. Driving at 73 miles in Kentucky, and driving at 35 miles in Michigan.
