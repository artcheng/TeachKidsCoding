print ('Hello World')

#task 1: print your name


#task 2: print your name 5 times


#remove # to see how these print workds

#print ('Yi Cheng '*5)
#print ('Yi Cheng\n'*5)


#then try something wrong, read the error message and try to fix it

#print Yi Cheng
#print YiCheng

#The above two errors are different.
#The first one said you have a syntax error, which means the computer doesn't understand your code
#The second one saild YiCheng is not defined, which means the computer use YiCheng as a variable( we talk about it later),
# but it doesn't what what value is for this variable.

#Don't worry about the errors too much now. It is simply to know, when you write something wrong, the computer might tell you.
